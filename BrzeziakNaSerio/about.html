        <div>
            Hello! I am self-learnt solo-game-developer. I code, illustrate, and compose music for my games since more than a year. These are often small, simple projects but I try my best to make sure that every one of my creations have something unique, distinct from my, and other games on the market. I am also quite active on social media like Twitter and Discord, so you can easily reach me, and give some feedback, which I think is one of the most important things about developing games, and other software.        <div class="home-img-container">

                <h2>Me as a small developer</h2>

                I am studying at the time in college to improve myself, so I must divide me time between learning and working on my projects, which doesn’t stop me. I am still working on projects that I started, and sometimes tweaking the older ones. There is still work to be done with my approach to developing games, and expanding my list of skills, but it isn’t a problem, as you can see looking at a gallery of my productions.            </div>
            <div class="main-flex-item">
                <h2>Where did i came from</h2>
                The games I was firstly introduced to were RTS’s like Stronghold and StarCraft. This is probably why a really like those genres, but I do not limit my self to them. In gallery of my games, you can find a RTS, RPG, and even a roguelike. <br>
                The game engine I am using is Unity, because I found it easy to learn, and meet all my expectations. This I why most of my games are, and probably will be made with it.
